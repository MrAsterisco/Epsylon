# Epsylon
As a part of one of my exams at the University, we were asked to develop a custom language interpreter. We were given a list of rules that the language should follow and some example to tests.

## Development Patterns
The main suggestion for this project was the Development Pattern to use: we were asked to implement this interpreter with the Visitors pattern. You can find more information on this [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern).

## Known Issues
There are some issues with some special operators. I guess I misunderstood some of themâ€¦ Anyway, I won't commit anymore to this repository, so don't expect any correction.
